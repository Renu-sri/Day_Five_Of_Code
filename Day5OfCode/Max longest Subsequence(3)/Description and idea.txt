Given Array with natural numbers where we need to find the max sum of contiguous subsequence 
where we should not select 3 continuous members.


Idea is it is mentioned that no 3 continuous elements should be there,
but it is allowed to have 2 continuous elements.

So,
    
             
    M[i]=Max(A[i]+A[i-1]+M[i-3],
             A[i]+M[i-2],
             M[i-1])
